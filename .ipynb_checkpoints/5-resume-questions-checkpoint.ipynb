    "When describing past experiences, the common advice (and good advice) is to follow the STAR pattern.  Meaning to describe the situtation, task, action, and result.  For example, perhaps \n",
    "\n",
    "* The situation: is that the company needed to expand, so \n",
    "* Task: So we determined both our core customers, and top sales personel\n",
    "* Action: Asked analytics team to identify most profitable customers, and identify their characteristics.  And to identify top sales people, controlling for expected sales given the store and time period. \n",
    "* Result: So we could pursue these customers as we expanded, and hire similar salespeople.  We ended up hitting our growth goals of growing the customer base by 45% in six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above does a good job of explaining a previous experience.  Perhaps the only thing to improve is to take a moment to explain what they company did.  This will allow the interviewer to understand some of the challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when interviewees are asked to explain their experiences they often focus on the task, and action, but not so much on the situation or the result.  It's very important to **explain the situation**.  In other words, instead of saying that your past role was customer research, the interviewer will appreciate it a lot more if you give the context of an expansion.  In addition, it also shows that while pursuing the task you had in mind the goals of the company, which generally shows a good understanding of the problem and how your work fit into the larger goals.  Finally, it allows the interviewer to play along, if they faced the challenges of an expansion, what types of research would they want to do to help the company."

    "\n",
    "When talk about a past experience (and when practicing) consider what may be relevant to the position.  That's what you want to emphasize.  You do not need to list off everything you did for the job.  If you do, you'll leave the interviewer without any real takeaway, other than you did a lot.  If you're able to summarize your role they'll understand that there was a lot involved, and they'll also see you as a focused communicator.       \n",

All the while, you should present this using the STAR approach of explaining the situation and then the task involved."
