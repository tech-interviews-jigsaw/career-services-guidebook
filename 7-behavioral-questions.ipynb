    "When answering any behavioral questios, the *implicit* argument should be that given your past experiences and what you would like to lean and do in the future, you really are a good fit for the position and the company.  Doing this may take convincing -- of yourself.  You don't need to be over the top in the interview -- if you walk into the interview genuinely interested, it will come across.  Typicall a company will ask the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *How do you think you would be a good match for this company/role?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how your previous experience matches up with the company and role, a good tool is to take out your resume and the research you did in preparing for the interview, and see how the current position aligns with your past experiences and interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three dimensions on which there may be alignment: the subject matter of the company, the technical work you would be doing for the company, and the company culture.  Try to think about why you enjoyed similar work along either of these dimensions in the past, and why you would enjoy it going forward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Domain\n",
    "For example, if the role is a marketing role -- have you done previous work where you thought about the end product users, or attracting users?  What made that interesting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Technical \n",
    "Or does the work call for a lot of cloud computing, that will ask you to self-learn and figure out the best tool for the job?  Where have you previously done that -- it doesn't have to be a engineering role, but other roles may also be applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Culture\n",
    "If the job is a startup you can mention being in an environment where people are asked to be scrappy, or surrounded with people passionate about their work.  For a more corporate environment, perhaps you value being in a company that has a strong organizational structure, and can invest in employee growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When giving any of these answers it is important to stay positive.  For example don't say, well I can't work in a startup environment, so this culture really suits me.  That \"process of elimination\" approach indicates more what you don't enjoy than what you do enjoy."

But beyond the analysis, what I really grew to love was the coding and engineering that went along with it.

DBT, snowflake, Airflow) and how setting up the right infrastructure helped solve analytical problems for others.\n",
